page 43: percentage method, tax withholding steps
Use these steps to figure the income tax to withhold under
the percentage method.
1. Multiply one withholding allowance for your payroll
period (see Table 5, later) by the number of allowances
the employee claims.
2. Subtract that amount from the employee's wages.
3. Determine the amount to withhold from the appropriate
table on pages 45–46.
